The Workshop on Global AI Cultures to be held as part of [ICLR 2024](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024) on **May 11**. This is a cross-disciplinary workshop with experts in AI/ML and social sciences discussing how AI influences culture and how culture influences AI.  


# Description

## Problem Statement

Building globally-inclusive generative artificial intelligence (genAI) that encodes, respects, and valorizes cultural sensibilities as well as performs well for users across cultural contexts, is an important goal as we deploy generative AI products globally. However, existing evaluation, design and deployment practices are not oriented towards a diversity of global cultures, betraying these aims.  Emerging research already shows that within the current AI development pipeline only certain western cultures get centered, distributed and amplified. There is currently limited conversation within AI/ML communities on how to measure complex variables like cultural representation and social impact of emerging technologies. We also do not fully understand the cultural priorities and needs  of genAI users and of the human labor that powers genAI. If this relationship between AI and  global cultures is not examined we inadvertently could be universalizing western centered AI and create unforeseen impacts on global cultural production, values and consumption.  

To build inclusive AI for people, we must thus focus on how AI pipelines can be more globally inclusive, the cultural values and assumptions we center in our development processes and the cultural impact of emerging AI technologies. This understanding becomes urgently important as  new generative AI technologies are increasingly used globally to consume and produce cultural artifacts like art, stories, and music, raising questions of cultural quality, inclusion, and impact. 

Such a research agenda requires a cross-disciplinary effort between AI researchers considering the technical nuances of generative AI with scholars from the humanities and social sciences that have long thought about the social and cultural impacts of new technologies. We thus urgently need a cross-disciplinary and cross-community framework for understanding this multifaceted relationship between AI and Culture. 

## Aims and Importance
This workshop aims to begin a conversation between core AI researchers and experts from the social sciences and humanities to collectively develop a research agenda around the impact of genAI on cultures and the impact of cultural values on genAI. Through this focus, the workshop will encourage field building on deepening our understanding for how we can build and deploy globally inclusive genAI and how we can responsibly encode cultural knowledge into our technologies.   It will include discussions about:

1. **Conceptual and Theoretical Foundations for Cultural Inclusion in GenAI:**  What does global inclusion mean in the context of generative AI and what are the possibilities and challenges of  building culturally inclusive generative models?  
2. **Scalable Cultural Representation Evaluations:** How do we build evaluation and development pipelines that can test cross-cultural performance via cultural metrics such as representation, quality, impact, and inclusion at scale?  
3. **Culturally-Rich Training Datasets:** What are the features of a culturally representative training dataset and what processes and conditions are needed in order to create or curate such training data? 
4. **Methods to study cultural values of generativeAI:** How can we recognize and account for the different cultural values that are embedded in our AI pipelines? How do we bring our cultures of development in sync with our cultures of deployment?
5. **User Interactions with GenAI in Support of Cultural Inclusion:** Are there creative strategies that can reparatively promote the inclusion of subjugated cultural values through UI, deployment, or public education/advocacy?
6. **Cultural impacts of Generative AI:** How can we understand immediate and longer-term impacts of these technologies on the culture industries?  How does AI support or challenge support existing dynamics in the culture industries?  Are there existing norms or principles in non-AI systems of content creation and distribution?
